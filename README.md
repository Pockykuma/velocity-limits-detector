# velocity-limits-detector

This project is written in Go and TypeScript, so Go and Node need to be installed first.<br />

To test, execute `go test`.<br />
To run the backend server, execute `go run main.go`.<br />
To run the frontend web app, in a new terminal, at the root directory run `cd react-typescript`, `npm install` and `npm run dev`, then the app should be found at http://localhost:1234.<br />
